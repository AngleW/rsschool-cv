## About Me
**For now...**
For now I'm on way to change my life and professional direction
My goal: work&travel. I want to earn money remotely and visit as many countries as possible with my wife
IT world is the most suitable for achieving my goal and my learning ability is my reliable tool for sure
I've decided to start with Python / HTML&CSS / JS
The most interesting fields for me: BigData, Cyber Security, AI, UX, Game Design, IoT

**And this is my story:**
* A. HR Director + B. Event Producer = C. Summary of my experience
+ Part A.
    In 2008, I joined the HR department of Atlant-M, the largest automotive holding company in Belarus, as a student intern.

    In the beginning, I had only three tasks. The first is to show up to work on time. The second is to observe and communicate. The third is to learn from one of the best HR managers in the country.

    In my 5 years on the job, my list of responsibilities has expanded considerably. I have worked confidently in the full range of duties and functions of HR manager:
    - Human resource planning
    - Recruitment and selection
    - Performance Management
    - Learning and development
    - Career planning
    - Job evaluation
    - Rewards
    - Employee Involvement and Communication
    - Health and safety
    - Personal well-being
    - And some other administrative tasks

    I also oversaw several HR development and education projects, organized professional competitions, and was part of the large organizing team for Atlant-M's largest corporate event each year (https://youtu.be/lOMqWnbwnBY).

    For another year I worked as HR director at the production company GLASSBEL. In this position, I gained experience in cooperation with the owners of the company both in Belarus and in the EU (production facilities in Klaipeda, Lithuania)

    It was a time of awareness and personal discovery.
    I felt the strength and confidence to pursue my own business 

+ Part B.
    I started a business and have been providing smart events for the largest clients in the country for 7 years

    In my experience, there are about 500+ projects with dozens of large and small companies and individual clients [Portfolio in Russian](https://igraroom.by/otzyvy "Portfolio in Russian") 

    The formula for success in my events: Mindfulness + Intelligence + Invigorating Physical Activity.

    What I love most about my work:
    - Organizing people and structuring the world around them for the needs of the event
    - Offering clients really good solutions for a given budget and making a little extra (everyone loves bonuses :)
    - And of course, to convey vivid emotions, or even better - to change many people's lives for the better
